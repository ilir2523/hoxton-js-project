For the Ionian Coast, divers have their pick between the area north of Saranda, in Dhërmi, Jal, and Cape of Lagji, among others.   In the last years alone, joint Albanian-American expeditions have been crucial in discovering old and drowned ships in the area, some of which reach a depth of 33 m and a length of 150 m. Vlorë Bay ‘hides’ many such treasures, being home to several sunken ships of considerable antiquity. However, the most famous and popular sunken ship discovered in Albanian waters, is the Italian hospital ship “PO”, which sank in March 1941, after being shot by “Swordfish,” a British airplane. A sunken ship back to century III or IV B.C.E was discovered north of Saranda Bay and is considered one of the best-preserved relics in the Mediterranean.
